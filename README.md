# Script to calculate  particle-size distribution (PSD) in matlab
This script calculate probability density function in number and volume in matlab

For theory you can look on: 
[Probability_density_function Wikipedia Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function)

Data was given by Pr. Ansart is a real distribution of him particle distribution you can find in him paper. 
It was used by myself for somes numericals simulations.
